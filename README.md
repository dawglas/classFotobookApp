# classFotobookApp
Hey good people,with all the help I can get, I want to build a class Fotobook app for mobile. This app should contain well laid out images sitting pretty on a nice background plus some nifty buttons.Before a class mate uses this app,she needs to provide his/her phone number/name which shall be checked against data stored in the app, and if true, I would want this app to describe them with some words of my(your) choice.The app should also have a search functionality to check through images.We can add more interesting features such as geolocation plus more. Thats alot of words but c'mon lets have fun and bring your ideas!!
